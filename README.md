# 25Karma

[25Karma](https://25karma.github.io) is an online player stats viewer for the Hypixel Network. Its primary objective is to display the stats that people actually care about, so that you no longer find yourself digging for them in drop-down menus. It also aims to be exceptionally easy to use - find everything you need to know about a player in as few clicks as possible.
